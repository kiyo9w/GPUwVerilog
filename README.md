# GPUwVerilog
Simple GPU Design in Verilog

We are a group of students working on designing a simple GPU using Verilog. Our aim is to study and implement basic GPU functionalities to help us understand more on hardware designs and parallel processing.

We have taken some inspiration from [adam-maj/tiny-gpu](https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu), our project is independently developed to suit our learning objectives.

## Completed Tasks by Week

|# Week | Tasks Completed                                |
